## How to Locally Install Moody to your Browser

#### Step 1
Place Moody in a location that will be easy for you to find, ensuring that you remember exactly where you stored it as this will be needed later during the installation process. This process can also be used to install any other broswer extensions you have saved locally.

#### Step 2
Open your broswer, this can be any browser you use the most, open **Settings**
